# Privacy Policy for Prompter Pro  
**Last Updated: September 2025**

## Introduction  
Prompter Pro (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how your information is handled when you use our browser extension.

## What We Collect  
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Everything happens locally on your device.  

* **No Accounts:** We don’t require sign-in or create user profiles.  
* **No Analytics:** We don’t track usage, events, or behavior.  
* **No Server Storage:** We do not run servers that store your data.  

## How Prompter Pro Works  
* **Local Processing:** Prompt enhancement logic runs locally in your browser.  
* **Direct API Calls:** When you choose to enhance text, your browser extension makes direct calls to AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) using your API keys.  
* **We Don’t See Your Data:** We don’t proxy, receive, or store your prompts or results on our servers.  
* **Your Choice:** You configure which providers to use and supply your own API keys.  

## Local Data on Your Device  
* **What:** API keys and extension settings/preferences.  
* **Where:** Stored locally in your browser (e.g., Chrome storage).  
* **Control:** Only you can access, edit, or remove this data on your device.  

## What We Do NOT Collect  
We do not collect:  
* Personal information (names, emails, addresses)  
* Financial, health, or sensitive categories of data  
* Authentication credentials  
* Location data or browsing history  
* Selected text content beyond direct calls you initiate to AI providers  
* Any data from websites you visit outside your explicit enhancement action  

## Data Sharing and Third Parties  
* **No Third-Party Sharing:** We don’t sell, rent, or share your data.  
* **AI Providers Only (Direct):** When you enhance text, the selected text goes directly from your browser to the AI provider you chose, using your API keys. Your interactions are governed by those providers’ privacy policies.  

## Data Security  
* **Local-Only:** Your keys and settings are stored locally and are not accessible to us.  
* **Transport Security:** Direct API requests to providers use HTTPS.  
* **No Server Exposure:** We can’t expose what we never receive.  

## International Data Transfers  
Not applicable. We do not collect or store data. If you use an AI provider, any transfers occur directly between your browser and that provider.  

## Data Retention  
* **Selected Text:** Not retained by us.  
* **Settings and API Keys:** Persist locally until you remove them or uninstall the extension.  
* **Server-Side Retention:** None—no servers.  

## Your Rights and Control  
* View, update, or remove your settings and API keys in the extension.  
* Clear data via your browser settings.  
* Uninstalling the extension removes all local data stored by the extension.  

## Children’s Privacy  
Prompter Pro is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  

## Changes to This Policy  
We may update this policy periodically. Continued use of Prompter Pro after changes indicates acceptance. The “Last Updated” date reflects the latest revision.
